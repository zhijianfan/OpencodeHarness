# UI Design — Chat Delivery: Steer & Queue

Status: implemented on `feature/UnrealViewer`
Related: [workspace-canvas/requirements.md](./workspace-canvas/requirements.md), [workspace-canvas/architecture.md](./workspace-canvas/architecture.md), [functionality-subsystem-management-architecture.md](./functionality-subsystem-management-architecture.md) (pending-input projection + cancellation extension)

## 1. Overview

The chat composer offers two explicit delivery actions while the session is busy:

| Action | Where | Behavior |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Steer** | Primary send button (Enter / click) | Prompt is admitted and steers the running agent at the next safe provider-turn boundary. |
| **Queue** | Secondary button next to send | Prompt is **sent immediately** to the host and queued host-side; the host promotes it when the current run finishes. |

The queue is no longer a client-side holding area. The message leaves the client
at the moment the user clicks Queue; durability and ordering live on the server.

## 2. Semantics (server contract)

Per the session runtime contract (`CONTEXT.md`):

- A prompt sent with `delivery: "steer"` is durably admitted and promoted at the
  next **Safe Provider-Turn Boundary**, resetting the agent's provider-turn
  allowance once per boundary.
- A prompt sent with `delivery: "queue"` is durably admitted but **not promoted**
  while the current **Session Drain** requires continuation. The runner promotes
  one queued prompt when the session would otherwise become idle, then
  re-evaluates continuation before promoting another.
- Both deliveries go through `sessions.prompt({ ..., delivery })`; the server
  already persists admitted inputs (`SessionInput.admit`), emits
  `session.input.admitted`, and later `session.input.promoted`.

## 3. Composer UI

### 3.1 Availability

The Queue button is visible when:

- a session exists,
- the session is busy (`session_working`),
- the composer is not blocked (permissions/question dock),
- the session is not a child/subagent session.

Otherwise only the normal send button is shown (delivery is irrelevant when idle).

### 3.2 v2 composer (new layout, default)

- Submit button: unchanged (send → steer; stop when input is blank).
- Queue button: `ButtonV2` ghost-muted, label `ui.promptInput.queue` ("Queue"),
  tooltip `ui.promptInput.queue.description`, rendered immediately left of the
  submit button, hidden in shell mode.
- Clicking Queue submits the current draft with `delivery: "queue"` and clears
  the composer, exactly like a normal send.

### 3.3 v1 composer (legacy layout)

Same behavior in the legacy `PromptInput`: a labeled Queue button (`Button`
ghost, reuse of the `settings.general.row.followup.option.queue` label and
description keys) appears next to the arrow submit button under the same
availability rule. Enter and the arrow always steer.

### 3.4 Feedback after queueing

- The message appears in the timeline immediately (optimistic add), as a sent
  user message.
- The host admits it durably; on promotion the reducer appends the authoritative
  message, deduplicated by message id against the optimistic copy.
- Queueing does **not** mark the session busy/idle optimistically — the session
  is already busy and stays busy until the agent run completes.

## 4. What was removed

- The client-side follow-up queue (the "queued prompts" dock with
  Send-now / Edit) is deleted. Queueing is host-side; editing a queued prompt is
  out of scope until the server exposes an input-edit operation.
- The `followup` general setting ("Steer vs Queue" default) is removed. Delivery
  is now an explicit per-message choice; Enter always steers.

## 5. Edge cases

| Case | Behavior |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Queue clicked with empty input | No-op (same guard as send). |
| Queue clicked in shell mode | Button hidden; shell commands always steer. |
| Queue clicked for a slash-command | Button hidden where possible; commands use the command API and steer. |
| Queue while a new-session composer is shown | Button only renders for existing sessions. |
| Send fails after queueing | Same failure path as steer: optimistic message removed, input restored, toast shown. |
| Multiple queued prompts | Host promotes them one at a time as the drain idles; client timeline shows each when promoted (optimistic copies dedupe). |

## 6. Accessibility

- The Queue button is a real `<button>` with a text label, keyboard reachable.
- Tooltip and label are localized; Enter/Tab behavior unchanged.
- No new keyboard shortcuts in v1.

## 8. Agent Canvas — Visual Design

Status: implemented on `feature/UnrealViewer` (prototype pass)
Related: [workspace-canvas/requirements.md](./workspace-canvas/requirements.md), [workspace-canvas/architecture.md](./workspace-canvas/architecture.md)

The product UI adopts a canvas-workspace visual language: an infinite dotted
canvas, draggable glass cards, soft glassmorphism, rounded corners, calm pastel
accents, **no wires** — a floating toolbar and smooth animations, responsive,
minimal JavaScript. It should feel more like a freeform desktop app than a node
editor or a web page.

### 8.1 Art style

- **Infinite dotted canvas.** The panel renders a dotted grid that follows the
  camera (pan/zoom). Two soft ambient pastel blobs (purple, mint) sit in the
  background; the app background is a radial pastel gradient over a calm base
  color.
- **Glassmorphism cards.** Every block is a rounded card (24px radius) with a
  translucent surface, `backdrop-filter: blur(18px) saturate(1.12)`, a 1px hairline
  border, and a soft drop shadow. Selected cards get an accent ring.
- **Pastel accent palette.** Per-module accents: purple (chat), blue (context),
  mint (tools), yellow (files), peach (scratchpad), pink (voice). Gradients pair
  purple → blue for primary actions.
- **Floating chrome.** Toolbar (top center), module dock (left edge), status pill
  and hint pill (bottom left), zoom control (bottom right) — all glass pills with
  hairline borders and soft shadows, floating above the canvas.
- **Motion stays quiet.** Transitions are short (120–180ms); animate state
  changes (selection, collapse, toast, typing dots, voice pulse), not decoration.
  `prefers-reduced-motion` collapses all animation.
- **Light and dark.** The theme is a `data-theme`/`data-color-scheme` switch;
  every surface, line, and accent re-resolves via CSS variables.

### 8.2 Interaction

- **Pan**: drag empty canvas (or hold Space and drag). **Zoom**: wheel (zoom
  towards the cursor), zoom buttons, `+`/`-`/`0`.
- **Blocks**: drag by header, resize from the corner handle, collapse via header
  action, bring-to-front on pointerdown, remove via header action or
  `Delete`/`Backspace` when selected.
- **Editing mode** (toolbar toggle): grid + outlines + resize handles + the add
  palette are visible; block transforms are live. Outside editing mode blocks
  render content and ignore transform gestures (content keeps full interactivity).
- **Double-click** empty canvas adds a scratchpad block; `N` adds one centered.
- **Tidy** reflows visible blocks into rows; **Reset view** restores the camera.
- **Persistence**: camera + block transforms persist to local storage
  (prototype pass; host-authoritative layout storage is the target per FR-7).

### 8.3 Canvas blocks

The pinned OpenCode fallback block is removed. A new canvas starts empty;
users add registered blocks from the palette. Session content is rendered by
the dedicated session blocks rather than an embedded legacy routed page.
Historical `builtin:chat` layout records and local `legacy` blocks are ignored
when restoring the canvas and are omitted from subsequent layout saves.

### 8.4 Implementation map

| Concern | File | Notes |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Standalone renderer | `packages/app/src/pages/canvas/workspace.tsx` | camera, blocks, chrome, gestures; pure UI, no backend calls |
| Communication subsystem | `packages/app/src/pages/canvas/manager.ts` | layout sync, revision/authority, OperatingAgent/model selection, permission config, server events; hands server-authoritative state to the UI via callbacks/signals |
| Camera math | `packages/app/src/pages/canvas/editor/camera.ts` | pan/zoom/clamp; frozen `snapshotCamera` bases for gestures (live Solid store proxies must never be captured as gesture bases) |
| Snapping grid | `packages/app/src/pages/canvas/editor/grid.ts` | snap, packed panel, overlap, fit (pre-existing, tested) |
| Art style | `packages/app/src/pages/canvas/canvas.css` | dotted grid, glass cards, pastel tokens, dark scheme; drag disables backdrop-filter for paint cost |
| Layout authority | `packages/core/src/workspace/service.ts`, `layout_authority` table | `clientID` claim on pull; `handed-over`/`conflict` results; transient `workspace.layout.updated` event published on save (realtime fan-out) |
| Functionality mapping   | `FUNCTIONALITY_BY_TYPE` in workspace.tsx; `builtins` in core service         | canvas modules use registered `builtin:*` ids; the retired `builtin:chat` block is excluded                                                                         |
| Permission config | `manager.loadConfig()` | project config via directory-scoped SDK; deny-all created when missing; live reload on `config.updated` |
| Pan diagnostics | `vite.config.ts` `/__canvas-pan-debug` → `.test-data/canvas-pan-debug.jsonl` | dev-only gesture sampling used to diagnose the pan-amplification bug |

**Interactions (final)**: blocks select/raise on click in any mode; move/
resize/collapse and the block bar are editing-mode-only; position snaps to the
16px grid once on release; pan works with left or right button (context menu
suppressed during right-pan) and keeps the grabbed point locked under the
cursor at any zoom; wheel zooms towards the cursor except over scrollable card
content. Transform ownership lives in a `createEffect` (DOM-sync) — the render
never writes rects, which made rendered and stored positions diverge during
mid-gesture updates.

## 9. Extension (design, not yet implemented)

The functionality subsystem architecture extends this design with a
server-projected pending-input list: a Pending Inputs button with count, per-item
status badges (`steer`, `queued`, `cancel-requested`, `cancelled`), a cancel
action per pending input (`session.input.cancel`), and Stop Current Run
(`session.run.cancel`). The pending list is a projection returned by
`session.input.listPending` and updated by server events — it is **not** a
client-side queue. Race handling (cancel vs promotion) is deterministic and
host-serialized. This section is authoritative for the implemented composer;
the subsystem architecture is authoritative for the pending-input extension.

## 10. MasterAgent block (`builtin:master-agent`) — final design

Status: implemented on `feature/UnrealViewer` (V4 documentation pass)
Related: [master-agent-max-parallel-plan architecture](../devplan/master-agent/master-agent-max-parallel-plan/01-architecture-decisions.md),
`docs/master-agent.md` (implementation map), `docs/master-agent-verification.md` (gate).

The MasterAgent block is a canvas card that embeds the existing Session surface
and adds a host-owned session lifecycle and workspace-wide Coder delegation. It
is not a second chat implementation: messages, composer, terminal, file tree,
and review/diff panel are the same reusable surface the routed Session page
uses, mounted with an isolated per-block scope (`master-agent-<blockID>`), so
two blocks never share DOM ids, portals, terminal mounts, or keyboard focus.
Keyboard commands affect only the focused block; each block is a separate host
Session.

### 10.1 Authority and presentation

- **Provider authentication** is shared across Operating Chat and MasterAgent.
  OpenAI models use the connected API key or ChatGPT OAuth
  account, including token refresh; a block does not choose its own auth mode.
  In the combined OpenCode host, the saved OpenAI login is also exposed to
  V2 sessions so an older database key cannot override that login.
  ChatGPT OAuth uses Codex/Work allowance; API keys use separate API billing.
  ChatRelay uses one Settings browser login and an owned regular ChatGPT tab per
  block, with automated submission and replies displayed in the block.
  It does not submit through the OpenCode provider
  or session pipeline. See [ChatRelay architecture](../relay/architecture.md).
- The **host functionality instance** owns the authoritative Session binding
  (session id, generation, revision) per block; the canvas owns **presentation
  only**. Layout JSON stores just block identity and transform — session ids,
  revisions, and queue state never enter layout serialization, `localStorage`,
  or IndexedDB.
- On mount the block resolves its binding (`get`/`ensure`); removal unmounts the
  surface and drops only the local projection — the host Session, running work,
  and admitted queue are preserved and re-resolved on the next mount.
- Binding updates arrive as transient events; after reconnect the block
  refetches authoritative state. Status states rendered in the card:
  connecting, not initialized, permission denied, unavailable, error (with
  Retry), and ready.

### 10.2 Block anatomy

- **Session slot**: full embedded Session surface (composer, timeline, terminal,
  file tree, review panel) bound to the block's session.
- **Footer — Workspace Coder**: a workspace-wide model selector (label
  **Workspace Coder**, "Workspace-wide" scope hint) shared by every MasterAgent
  block. Choose/Change/Clear with saving state; warnings for same-as-primary
  and known tool-call limitations; disabled with an explanatory message when
  the project config denies `task`. Coder tasks always run on this model — the
  primary model is never used as a fallback.
- **Footer actions**: **Reset session** (enabled only while the session is idle
  with no pending input; replaces this block's binding with a fresh host
  session and preserves the old session in history) and **Full page** (opens
  the bound session in the routed Session page).

### 10.3 Queue inside the block

The embedded composer reuses the existing Queue action from §1–5 unchanged:
while the session is busy, Queue sends `delivery: "queue"` immediately through
the host admission path; pending state is projected from server events;
promotion is host-ordered at drain-idle boundaries. There is no block-local or
browser queue — removing the visual block never discards host-admitted inputs.

### 10.4 Coder mode (enabled behavior)

When a Coder model is set, the primary session delegates repository mutation,
build, test, and shell-based debugging to a host-created child `coder` session;
direct edit/write/patch and unrestricted agent shell tools are removed from the
primary's effective tool set (read/search/context remain), and the reserved
`coder-task` tool is exposed unless `task` is denied. The host chooses the
child's model, directory, parent, workspace, agent, and permissions — the model
never does. An unavailable or tool-call-incompatible Coder model fails visibly
with no fallback. User-operated terminal UI keeps its existing permission
behavior. Ordinary sessions and `builtin:chat` are unchanged.

### 10.5 Limitations (v1)

Fixed directory bindings have no client patch path; Coder selection is
workspace-wide with no per-block override; queued inputs cannot be edited or
cancelled from the UI; child Coder sessions are not resumable from the block.
See `docs/master-agent.md` for the complete list and implementation map.
