# Workspace Canvas — Requirements & Design

Branch: `feature/UnrealViewer`
Status: historical canvas draft with implemented resolutions; OperatingChat
context requirements §3.7 approved for future implementation on 2026-08-25

## 1. Overview

OpenCode's UI becomes a workspace-canvas application. The **Workspace** is the
outermost container in the product: it owns layouts, directories, plugins, skills,
and git repository tracking. The host server stores workspaces; any client viewer
loads them. The page consists of a single top bar plus one full-page **panel** in
which user-defined **blocks** (squares that render a functionality) are arranged on
a snapping canvas. A **layout** stores only block transforms and references to
functionalities — never block content.

## 2. Terminology

| Term             | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Workspace        | Outermost container: named entity owning layouts, directories, plugins, skills, git tracking                                                                                                                                      |
| Host             | The OpenCode server instance that owns durable storage (sidecar or remote)                                                                                                                                                        |
| Client viewer    | The web/desktop UI that loads and renders a workspace                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Top bar          | Single horizontal bar at the top of the page                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Panel            | The remaining viewport area, entirely blank except for blocks                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Block            | A square region inside the panel that renders one functionality's content                                                                                                                                                         |
| Functionality    | A registered kind of content a block can render (chat, terminal, file tree, viewer, …)                                                                                                                                            |
| Layout           | Ordered set of block records: `{ id, functionality ref, transform }`; the workspace's block arrangement, which also governs functionality availability (replaces the former _Environment_ preset, per `ImplementationPlan` ADR-2) |
| Editing mode     | Panel state in which blocks can be added, resized, moved, snapped                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Style            | Visual/density/layout preference used in layout resolution (per ADR-2)                                                                                                                                                            |
| Device           | A client device class or specific device used to key layout storage                                                                                                                                                               |
| OperatingAgent   | The model configured per workspace for its OperatingChat SessionV2 bindings                                                                                                                                                       |
| OperatingContext | The model-visible request assembled by SessionV2 from a Context Epoch baseline, active history, admitted turn sidecars, compaction, and tools                                                                                         |
| BlockSubsystem   | The functionality/domain behind a block; contributes typed identity, data, or context references but does not own a second transcript or prompt assembler                                                                            |
| Pseudo block     | A block whose functionality reroutes to an external service (e.g. ChatRelay)                                                                                                                                                      |

## 3. Functional requirements

### 3.1 Workspace as outermost container

- **FR-1** A workspace is a named entity with a stable id.
- **FR-2** A workspace contains, in this nesting order:
  - layouts (one or more; see §3.5)
  - directories (one or more project directories)
  - plugins (a selection of enabled plugins)
  - skills (a selection of enabled skills)
  - git repository tracking (per directory or workspace-wide; see §8.7)
- **FR-3** Workspaces support create, rename, delete, duplicate, and activate.
- **FR-4** The workspace supersedes the current project concept: project selection
  UI is disabled; all navigation starts from the workspace.

### 3.2 Host storage & client loading

- **FR-5** The workspace record, its layouts, and all layout options are stored on
  the host server, not in client local storage.
- **FR-6** A client viewer can list workspaces and load a workspace by id; the load
  response contains the workspace record plus the layout resolved for this
  (user, style, device) tuple.
- **FR-7** Layout mutations are write-through to the host. Clients hold a
  lightweight cache for offline rendering, but the host is authoritative.
- **FR-8** Workspace data is scoped per user (see §8.2 for identity).

### 3.3 Top bar arrangement

- **FR-9** Workspace configuration is arranged horizontally at the left of the top
  bar: workspace switcher, workspace name (editable), layout/style selector,
  and editing-mode toggle.
- **FR-10** All other OpenCode default interactable UI elements move to the right
  side of the top bar: server/connection status, model selector, agent selector,
  theme, notifications, settings, help. The model selector configures the
  workspace's OperatingAgent model.
- **FR-11** The top bar is a single row on desktop; it must degrade gracefully on
  narrow screens (overflow menu) — behavior per device class TBD (§8.6).

### 3.4 Panel and blocks

- **FR-12** Everything below the top bar is one blank panel. No home screen, no
  sidebar, no dock by default; all content lives inside blocks.
- **FR-13** A block is initially square (width = height). It renders exactly one
  functionality's content inside its bounds.
- **FR-14** Blocks can be added from a functionality palette; the palette lists
  built-in functionalities plus workspace-enabled plugin functionalities
  (skills are enablements, not blocks — see §5.2).
- **FR-15** Blocks are resizable, movable, and snap to a grid when edited
  (FR-16). Snap behavior: cells, min/max sizes, collision rules (§8.7).
  The panel is **not scrollable** — the canvas always fits the viewport —
  and empty packing strips of 5% of the panel are reserved on the left and
  right sides; blocks cannot be placed or resized into the packing.
- **FR-17** Blocks have a z-order; overlapping is only allowed in editing mode and
  resolves to a deterministic order on exit (§8.7).
- **FR-18** Block content is live: each block renders its functionality against
  the active workspace scope (directories, plugins, skills).
- **FR-19** A block carries no content state of its own. All state lives in the
  functionality's backing data (sessions, terminals, files, …) which survives
  layout changes.

### 3.5 Layouts

- **FR-20** A layout stores only block records: `{ id, functionality, transform }`
  where transform = `{ x, y, w, h, z }` in panel grid units.
- **FR-21** The layout contains no block content, no sessions, no view state.
- **FR-22** Layouts are versioned (revision number) so clients can detect staleness.
- **FR-23** The default layout is empty. Users add registered blocks from the
  palette; the canvas does not create a pinned OpenCode fallback block.
- **FR-24** The host stores layout options **per user, per style, per device**
  (§8.4 for the precise tuple).

### 3.6 Editing mode

- **FR-25** Editing mode is toggled from the top bar. In editing mode the panel
  shows the grid, block outlines, and handles.
- **FR-26** In editing mode blocks can be: added (palette), resized (corner/edge
  handles), moved (drag), snapped (to grid cells), and removed.
- **FR-27** Leaving editing mode persists the resulting layout to the host for the
  current (user, style, device) tuple.
- **FR-28** Outside editing mode, blocks render content and ignore transform
  gestures.

### 3.7 OperatingAgent context assembly

- **FR-29** Each `builtin:operating-chat-session` block owns one durable
  SessionV2 binding through its host FunctionalityInstance. The block and
  browser do not own a parallel transcript or context stack.
- **FR-30** SessionV2 derives OperatingChat workspace, block, functionality,
  instance, generation, revision, directory, and model-policy identity from the
  existing live server binding. The browser may project that target only to
  materialize an explicit capsule; it cannot nominate admission authority.
- **FR-31** The selected agent instruction, OperatingChat host identity,
  environment, project instructions, skills, and references participate in the
  existing Context Epoch. Its cached baseline remains byte-stable until a
  defined epoch replacement.
- **FR-32** The visible Session transcript stores the user's original text. Any
  host-injected context is stored in a private, immutable, versioned input
  sidecar rather than rewriting that message.
- **FR-33** The model-facing sidecar records the exact canonical user text sent
  to the provider layer, its hash and renderer version, CtxPack provenance, and
  sanitized recall metadata.
- **FR-34** The OperatingChat composer retains explicit CtxPack attachments.
  Non-trivial OperatingChat turns also receive automatic workspace-scoped
  CtxPack recall. Generic SessionV2 turns do not receive automatic recall.
- **FR-35** Explicit attachments have priority and fail admission when invalid.
  Automatic candidates fill only the remaining count/byte/token budget and may
  be omitted on recall failure. The final rendered envelope, including wrapper
  and provenance, is the budget authority; auto overflow drops ranked tail
  candidates while explicit overflow rejects.
- **FR-36** Automatic recall is deterministic, permission-filtered, sensitivity-
  aware, deletion-aware, content-hash checked, scans at most 16 fixed-policy
  candidates, and selects at most four packs/eight combined attachments. It
  reads immutable fragments without creating a durable ContextCapsule row.
- **FR-37** Recall runs only on first durable admission. An exact same-message-ID
  retry reuses its stored sidecar without search or materialization; changed
  explicit capsule/pack identity, content hash, or label conflicts. Concurrent
  contenders reload/validate the winner, and only the invocation that committed
  the event records CtxPack usage.
- **FR-38** Every later active provider turn replays the exact stored model-facing
  content for enriched historical user messages while public projections remain
  clean.
- **FR-39** Tool calls and tool results remain ordinary SessionV2 history and are
  included in the same provider-context loop. No second operation queue or tool
  loop is introduced.
- **FR-40** Existing SessionV2 compaction consumes enriched historical user
  content in a private message sidecar, keeps its public durable event free of
  recalled fragments, and never deletes the underlying messages, inputs,
  sidecars, or events.
- **FR-41** OperatingChat admission reruns the authoritative lookup and
  revalidates the full Session workspace/location/directory plus binding
  instance/generation/revision proof inside the admission event transaction. A
  concurrent reset/reconfiguration, move/warp, or binding acquired after generic
  resolution cannot commit a sidecar under stale authority.
- **FR-42** Missing actor identity disables automatic recall with sanitized
  unavailable state and never synthesizes a user; explicit selection still
  fails closed. An established generic composer uses
  `chat-instance:<sessionID>`/`builtin:chat`, and a no-Session composer disables
  CtxPack drop.
- **FR-43** Every V2 admission publishes only a content-free requiredness marker
  and atomically replaces its projected pending slot with the private sidecar.
  Pending inputs and private compaction sentinels fail closed when their payload
  is missing or corrupt.
- **FR-44** Empty-destination import and same-workspace host sync use one typed,
  versioned private-transfer bundle for input/compaction sidecars and the active
  Context Epoch. Network transfer requires a configured valid host credential;
  private repair discovers at most 128 aggregates per batch. Every serialized
  source-high-water page is at most 512 KiB and carries at most 256 complete
  public events or 64 chunks for one oversized public/private record; both forms
  spool and apply atomically. Public global events contain no
  bundle and expose coalesced sync hints only after authenticated
  transfer-version negotiation. V2 private admission is disabled until all
  managed peers negotiate v1; topology/capability changes
  invalidate the revisioned readiness proof before admission commit. A
  non-v1 peer cannot join after self or any drained worker reports a non-null
  V1/V2 input sidecar, pending marker, private checkpoint, Context Epoch, or
  retained durable V2 marker/private-sentinel event, including one later reverted.
  Managed mixed-version placement rejects explicit attachments; only strictly
  local/no-sync placement may retain a V1 explicit snapshot. Phase 1 rejects
  every Session workspace/location warp unconditionally before final sync,
  prompt cancellation, replay, claim, or filesystem change.
  An existing EventV2 row with a missing projected target returns a typed
  projection defect unless the same frozen snapshot proves a later
  authoritative revert intentionally deleted that exact target; this feature
  does not provide arbitrary re-projection. A retained revert with a still-
  present target is also a defect and cannot authorize implicit projector replay.

## 4. Non-functional requirements

- **NFR-1** Layout load for the default tuple must be fast (< 300 ms p95 over local
  host); layout save is best-effort within 1 s.
- **NFR-2** Host storage survives server restarts; SQLite is acceptable for a
  single-tenant host (see architecture doc).
- **NFR-3** The panel must render ≥ 12 blocks at 60 fps on a mid-range device.
- **NFR-4** Offline: viewer may render the last cached layout read-only; edits made
  offline fail explicitly (no silent divergence).
- **NFR-5** Layout payloads are small (< 10 KB for 100 blocks) and versioned for
  cheap cache validation.
- **NFR-6** Accessibility: blocks are keyboard focusable and navigable; editing
  gestures have keyboard equivalents (arrow nudge, shift-resize).
- **NFR-7** Security: functionality references in layouts are validated against
  the workspace's enabled functionalities; unknown refs render an error block.
- **NFR-8** Recalled text, raw recall queries, model-facing sidecar content,
  selected-agent instructions, and OperatingChat binding/path policy
  never appear in layout JSON, browser persistence, events, ordinary logs, or
  error payloads. Admitted/compacted bytes cross hosts only through the existing
  versioned administrator sync transport with a configured valid host
  credential over HTTPS, literal `127.0.0.0/8`/`::1`, or an equivalent
  confidential channel; redirects and an otherwise-open or non-loopback plain-
  HTTP listener cannot negotiate it, and
  raw queries never cross it.
- **NFR-9** The same admitted Session input produces byte-identical canonical
  model-facing user text after a server restart.
- **NFR-10** Automatic recall adds no network round trip from the browser and no
  auxiliary model call; it uses the host's existing SQLite FTS index.
- **NFR-11** One strict decoder recomputes each input/compaction sidecar's
  canonical hashes, UTF-8 byte length, and token estimate at every authority
  read. Malformed or valid-shape tampered state fails the provider turn,
  compactor, export, and restore explicitly rather than silently dropping or
  recomputing context.
- **NFR-12** Failed or unavailable automatic recall leaves no orphan
  ContextCapsule rows.
- **NFR-13** A stale browser context-target projection cannot override the
  server-resolved OperatingChat profile.
- **NFR-14** Private-state history export is workspace-scoped and snapshot-
  consistent. Restore validates complete event identity/data hash, target,
  schema, and payload hash; duplicates are idempotent and conflicts fail closed.

## 5. Proposed design resolutions (draft defaults)

These are working assumptions — each maps to an ambiguity in §8.

1. **Block shape**: square by default (1:1 at creation), free rectangle after
   resize; "square block" is interpreted as the initial shape, not a hard
   constraint.
2. **Functionality registry**: namespaced IDs (`builtin:*`, `plugin:*`). The v1
   built-in set is `builtin:chat`, `builtin:online-search`,
   `builtin:screenshot-browser`, `builtin:application-window-stream` (see the
   functionality subsystem architecture); existing panels (terminal, file tree,
   diff, todos, viewer) migrate to the same interface incrementally. Skills are
   not blocks — they are workspace-scoped enablements consumed by blocks.
3. **"Style" vs "Layout"**: per `ImplementationPlan` ADR-2 —
   `layout` is the workspace's block arrangement, which governs its
   functionality availability (replaces the former `environment` preset);
   `style` is the visual/density/layout preference used in layout resolution.
   The storage tuple is (user, style, deviceClass); `deviceID` is deferred
   unless a per-machine restore requirement is approved (ADR-3).
4. **Default layout**: created lazily on first load of any tuple; chat block
   binds to the workspace's primary directory (first directory listed).
5. **Sessions**: remain directory-scoped; a chat block without a chosen session
   renders the most recent session of its bound directory (see §8.8).

## 6. Out of scope (v1)

- Multi-user collaborative editing of one layout.
- Remote/streamed rendering of exotic functionalities (e.g. full Unreal editor).
- Block-level theming beyond the style dimension.
- Migration of legacy project UI state into workspaces.
- Hermes memory/profile files, a second session database, or another execution
  backend.
- Vector/embedding retrieval and model-based recall reranking.
- A browser-owned OperatingContext or HistoricalContextStack.
- ChatRelay-to-OperatingAgent event forwarding.

## 7. Acceptance criteria (summary)

1. A workspace can be created, named, stored on the host, reloaded in a fresh
   client, and shows its directories/plugins/skills/git state.
2. The top bar matches §3.3: workspace config left, all other controls right.
3. Below the bar is a blank panel; the default layout shows one full-panel chat
   block.
4. In editing mode, blocks add/resize/move/snap; exiting persists a layout
   containing only transforms and functionality refs.
5. Layout options resolve per (user, style, device); changing device or style
   yields that tuple's layout, defaulting to the full-panel chat when absent.
6. OperatingChat keeps one clean SessionV2 transcript while an enriched turn
   replays exact canonical model-facing content after reload.
7. Explicit and automatic CtxPack context is bounded, authorized, immutable at
   admission, and absent from browser/layout/event storage.
8. Same-ID exact retry performs no second recall; changed explicit context
   conflicts.
9. Generic Sessions do not gain automatic recall.
10. Compaction preserves enriched facts in its checkpoint without deleting the
    complete durable Session history.
11. Empty-destination import and same-workspace host sync preserve sidecars plus
    the active epoch without exposing them in public events, including atomic
    import of intentionally reverted targets through validated content-free
    deletion proofs; every Session
    workspace/location warp fails before side effects in phase 1.

## 8. Ambiguities & missing items

This list is the requested deliverable for review. Items marked **Resolved**
track decisions in the functionality subsystem architecture
(`../functionality-subsystem-management-architecture.md`) or
`architecture.md`.

1. **Square vs rectangle** — is a block permanently square (aspect locked) or
   only square at creation? Proposal: square at creation, free resize after.
   **Resolved**: each functionality manifest declares
   `constraints.initialAspect` and `min/max` sizes; blocks are square at
   creation, free-resize after.
2. **Functionality inventory** — the exact built-in list is undefined. Which
   existing panels (terminal, file tree, diff, todos, images, viewer) are
   v1 blocks? **Resolved**: the Canvas starts empty and exposes registered,
   renderer-backed blocks from the palette. The retired `builtin:chat` remains
   a compatibility registry entry but is ignored during Canvas hydration;
   legacy panels migrate incrementally (see §5.2).
3. **Skills as blocks vs enablements** — do skills appear as blocks, or only as
   workspace config consumed by agent/chat blocks? Proposal: config only.
   **Resolved**: config only (FR-14, §5.2).
4. **"Style" definition** — is style a theme, a density, the layout preset,
   or a combination? Needs product decision. **Resolved**: split into
   `layout` (block arrangement → functionality availability; replaces the
   former `environment` preset) and `style` (visual/density/layout
   preference) per `ImplementationPlan` ADR-2.
5. **Device granularity** — class only (desktop/mobile/tablet), or also specific
   device ids (to restore per-machine layouts)? Class-only loses per-machine
   arrangements; device-id keying complicates the tuple and precedence.
   **Resolved for v1**: required tuple is
   `(workspace, user, style, deviceClass)`; `deviceID` deferred per ADR-3.
6. **User identity** — self-hosted OpenCode currently uses a single basic-auth
   username; cloud uses accounts. What identifies "user" for per-user storage?
   What happens for anonymous/local instances? **Resolved**: authenticated
   username (self-host), account user ID (account deployments), reserved
   `default` identity for local anonymous mode per ADR-4.
7. **Git tracking scope** — per directory or workspace-level? What is tracked
   (branches, status, remotes, dirty set) and how is it rendered (which block)?
8. **Chat block session binding** — does a block instance reference a session
   (conflicts with FR-19/FR-20) or does the chat block choose a session at
   runtime (directory + most-recent)? Proposal: runtime resolution, session id
   never stored in layout. **Resolved**: runtime resolution per the chat
   instance configuration (`sessionBinding` / `directoryBinding`); the session
   ID is never stored in layout data.
9. **Multiple directories & sessions** — how does a workspace with N directories
   map to chat blocks (one chat per directory, or a directory switch inside one
   block)? Block-per-directory needs a directory binding, which is content state.
   **Resolved**: directory binding lives in the functionality instance
   (`workspace-primary` or `fixed` directory), not in the layout.
10. **Editing rights** — which users may edit layouts (owner only vs any
    workspace member)? What is "member" for self-hosted? **Resolved**: the
    capability model (`read` / `write` / `execute`) governs layout and
    instance mutations; the host enforces it.
11. **Concurrent edits** — last-write-wins per layout, or per-block merge? Is
    multi-device live sync (SSE) needed in v1 or is load-on-navigation enough?
    **Resolved**: revision-checked last-write-wins on explicit retry (layouts)
    and revision-conflict errors for instance configuration; live SSE push is
    designed but deferred.
12. **Legacy surfaces** — are `/` (home) and `/:dir/session/:id` routes removed,
    redirected, or reachable via blocks only? What happens to the existing
    workspace sidebar (git worktrees) — naming collision with "Workspace".
13. **Snap details** — grid cell size, min/max block sizes, whether overlap is
    allowed, z-order persistence, resize snapping to multiples.
14. **Panel scale** — do blocks scale with viewport (percentage) or stay in
    fixed grid units with scroll? Per-device layouts partially answer this but
    the unit system is undefined.
15. **Block content lifecycle** — are non-visible blocks kept mounted (live),
    suspended, or recreated on view? Memory bound for 12+ blocks (terminals,
    viewers) is undefined. **Resolved**: per-manifest lifecycle policy
    (`clientWhenHidden`, `hostWhenNoViewers`) with a keep-alive matrix; host
    work survives block unmount unless cancelled explicitly.
16. **Offline semantics** — read-only cache vs queued edits; NFR-4 assumes
    read-only — confirm. **Resolved**: read-only cached layout; host-backed
    writes fail explicitly offline; no generic offline command queue in v1.
17. **Top bar overflow** — behavior on narrow/mobile widths for FR-10 controls.
18. **Functionality parameters** — blocks reference a functionality by id; do
    block instances carry parameters (e.g. "terminal:dir=…")? If yes, that must
    be part of the layout record and included in FR-20's "reference".
    **Resolved**: parameters live in a separate revisioned
    **functionality instance** keyed by `(workspace, block, functionality)`;
    layouts still contain only IDs and transforms (FR-20 unchanged).
19. **UnrealViewer specifics** — what does the viewer block render in a web
    client (native content, streamed viewport, static preview)? This is the
    namesake feature and currently undefined. **Partially resolved**: the
    `builtin:application-window-stream` block and backend interface are
    stabilized as an honest placeholder; the capture/transport backend remains
    undefined.
20. **Deleted entities** — what renders when a block's functionality, plugin,
    or directory is removed (error block, auto-remove on next edit)?
    **Resolved**: blocks render missing/disabled/unavailable/permission-denied
    states with a replace affordance; removed plugins invalidate their
    functionality refs and grants without destroying user data.

## Chat composer consistency

All chat message blocks must reuse the shared `PromptInputV2` editor and
`createPromptInputV2Controller`. A new block supplies candidate data, draft
identity, supported attachments, and its submission adapter. It must not fork
mention detection, keyboard selection, or token editing into a private textarea.

Typing `@` offers supported context types, including available skills. Selection
inserts a structured token, not a message submission. Skill identity survives
draft/history restoration, and removing a token removes that skill selection.
Candidate IDs include their category so files, agents, and skills with the same
name remain distinct. Catalog loads and drafts are scoped to the active server,
Location, and block; late responses cannot overwrite another composer's state.

Each transport must implement the semantics of every selectable category.
Native chats request the permission-checked skill tool. ChatRelay includes
validated skill instructions through its browser transport and keeps CtxPack
support; it does not advertise unsupported native agent/file/resource actions.
Native custom slash commands reject selected skills with a clear explanation
and retain the draft, because command templates may interpolate arguments into
shell snippets. The user can remove the command or the selected skill.

When adding a chat message block, extend
`packages/app/e2e/chat-mentions.spec.ts` to cover opening/filtering the picker,
keyboard selection without sending, removal, draft isolation, and the actual
submitted request. Shared editor tests cover caret offsets and IME input.
