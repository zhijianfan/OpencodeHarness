# Block Runtime v3 — Verified Contract

Status: implemented and verified 2026-08-24. This document is the final runtime
ownership contract. The worker instructions at the end are retained only as
historical constraints from the original parallel run.

## C1 — Layout purity

The host layout and the canvas descriptor cache contain only:

```ts
interface CanvasBlockDescriptor {
  id: string
  functionalityID: string
  transform: { x: number; y: number; w: number; h: number; z: number }
}
```

No session ID, binding revision, message, queue state, model execution state,
terminal state, file content, note content, or view state enters the layout
record.

## C2 — Optional runtime participation

Every block is registered with exactly one mode:

```ts
type BlockRuntimeMode = "native" | "projected" | "local" | "static"
```

- `native`: resolves host configuration but renders an existing OpenCode native surface/store.
- `projected`: consumes a compact block/domain projection through an adapter.
- `local`: state is device-local and isolated from layout.
- `static`: no runtime state.

## C3 — One event transport per active context

- Session state uses the existing OpenCode session/event path.
- Workspace and FunctionalityInstance changes use EventV2 through the existing app event client.
- Each active ServerSDK context selects its compatible V1 or V2 event endpoint;
  it never opens both. One context-level router fans that connection out to all
  mounted registrations.
- Event IDs survive the ServerSDK provider/router boundary. The router drops
  duplicate IDs from a bounded recent window before registrations observe them.
- No block opens a second session-message SSE stream.
- One prompt submission produces exactly one local OpenCode request.

## C4 — Backend emits semantic change events

The generic backend event contains no UI instructions or full domain state:

```ts
interface FunctionalityInstanceChanged {
  workspaceID: string
  blockID: string
  functionalityID: string
  instanceID: string
  revision: number
  change: "created" | "updated" | "tombstoned"
}
```

The frontend adapter decides whether to patch or refetch.

## C5 — Authoritative refresh on mount/reconnect

Transient events are hints. Every mounted host-backed adapter:

1. resolves authoritative state on mount;
2. listens for matching events;
3. coalesces invalidations;
4. refetches after reconnect or a revision gap, with at most one active or
   pending reconnect refresh per registration. A reconnect observed during a
   non-reconnect refresh schedules exactly one trailing authoritative refresh;
   semantic invalidation observed during a reconnect remains eligible for one
   trailing refresh;
5. preserves the last valid projection during transient failure.

If a typed resolve fails because the workspace disappeared, the generic host
uses the manager-provided recovery callback and retries that resolve once. A
second failure is surfaced; registrations do not own workspace recreation.

## C6 — Host-owned binding

OperatingChat and MasterAgent session IDs are returned by their host domain
services. Never selected from browser persistence, never copied into
layout/localStorage.

The binding's directory comes from the bound Session's location. Changing the
workspace's primary directory does not relocate an existing conversation;
creating or resetting a chat uses the current directory configuration.

Historical ChatRelay session bindings follow the same ownership rule, but the
active ChatRelay block uses local draft storage and a server-owned ChatGPT
browser tab. It does not resolve or resume an OpenCode session.

## C7 — Commands use domain ports

Session adapter commands call existing typed endpoints/ports:
`workspace.operatingChat.ensure/get/reset`,
`workspace.masterAgent.ensure/get/reset`, native Session composer/interrupt/permission
APIs, workspace update APIs. No generic provider or chat command endpoint.
ChatRelay draft commands use the block local-view store. Its typed `v2.chatProxy`
domain commands ensure/reset/open an owned browser tab and submit through the
visible ChatGPT composer. Workspace membership and block ownership are checked
on the server; browser commands never enter the SessionV2 pipeline.

## Final registration and host responsibilities

- A native registration resolves server-owned state after its descriptor is durable,
  selects a small view model, declares semantic event keys, returns
  `"invalidate"` when authority must be refetched, optionally dispatches a
  typed domain command, and disposes only resources it owns.
- `BlockRuntimeHost` owns identity changes, aborts, last-valid-view retention,
  event subscriptions, invalidation/reconnect coalescing, one retry after
  generic workspace recovery, and post-command refresh.
- `BlockRuntimeProvider` owns the single context router and reconnect fan-out.
  Manager connectivity transitions and post-initial `server.connected` events
  from the existing ServerSDK emitter share that path. ServerSDK, which owns
  the stream lifecycle, marks the first connection for that SDK context as
  initial and later retry/page-resume connections as reconnects. The Provider
  therefore handles a real reconnect even when it mounted after initial stream
  establishment, without refreshing on a true initial connection.
- `CanvasManager` owns workspace/layout/config authority and exposes recovery
  services. It does not synchronize ChatRelay bindings, poll ChatRelay state,
  or store a relay transcript.
- OperatingChat and MasterAgent render `CanvasSessionSurface`; SessionV2 owns
  admission, history, queue/steer, interruption, and execution state.
- ChatRelay renders its local draft and the browser worker's observed transcript.
  Its view polls browser state with disposal and request-overlap guards; the
  manager does not own that polling. It has no OpenCode provider/session dependency.

## C8 — Runtime identity

```text
workspaceEpoch + workspaceID + blockID + functionalityID
```

Shared domain resources may be ref-counted separately; per-block
descriptor/config/view state must never be overwritten by another block
sharing that resource.

## C9 — Workspace invalidation

Typed workspace-not-found: (1) clear stale in-memory + persisted ID;
(2) increment `workspaceEpoch`; (3) dispose runtime handles of the old
workspace; (4) resolve existing preferred workspace or create `Default` only
when none exist; (5) preserve unsaved local layout as a pending
local-authoritative snapshot; (6) notify the user the binding changed.

## C10 — No production mock fallback

Test mocks are imported only by tests. Missing providers/contexts render
explicit loading, unavailable, or error states.

## Frozen interfaces (shape; exact TS may change in S0 — ownership/data-flow may not)

```ts
interface BlockRuntimeRegistration<TResolved, TView, TCommand> {
  functionalityID: string
  mode: "native" | "projected" | "local" | "static"
  resolve(input: {
    workspaceID: string
    block: CanvasBlockDescriptor
    services: BlockRuntimeServices
    signal: AbortSignal
  }): Promise<TResolved>
  eventKeys?(resolved: TResolved): readonly RuntimeEventKey[]
  onEvent?(input: { event: ServerEvent; resolved: TResolved; services: BlockRuntimeServices }): "ignore" | "invalidate"
  select(input: { resolved: TResolved; projection: unknown; localView: unknown }): TView
  dispatch?(input: {
    resolved: TResolved
    command: TCommand
    services: BlockRuntimeServices
    signal: AbortSignal
  }): Promise<void>
  dispose?(resolved: TResolved): void
}

interface RuntimeBlockHandle<TView = unknown, TCommand = unknown> {
  status(): "resolving" | "ready" | "stale" | "unavailable" | "permission-denied" | "error"
  view(): TView | undefined
  error(): unknown
  refresh(reason?: string): Promise<void>
  dispatch(command: TCommand): Promise<void>
  dispose(): void
}

interface BlockRuntimeServices {
  serverSDK: Accessor<ServerSDK>
  eventRouter: BlockRuntimeEventRouter
  workspace: {
    id(): string | undefined
    epoch(): number
    connected(): boolean
    awaitDescriptorPersisted(blockID: string, signal: AbortSignal): Promise<void>
    recover?(error: unknown): Promise<boolean>
  }
  localView: BlockLocalViewStore
}

interface RuntimeEventKey {
  type: string
  workspaceID?: string
  blockID?: string
  functionalityID?: string
  resourceID?: string
}
```

Cursors from external sources are opaque strings. Generic types must not imply
numeric parsing. `RuntimeEventKey` is semantic and extensible — never a closed
union of `session | message | pty | file | review`.

## Frozen names

- Backend change event: `workspace.functionality.instance.changed`
- Local view state key: `opencode.canvas.local-view.v1` (one key, sub-keyed by block)
- Layout/descriptor cache key: `opencode-canvas-v1` (descriptor + transform only after D)
- Workspace ID persistence key: `opencode.canvas.workspaceID.v1`

## Prohibited patterns (any worker)

```text
/api/block-runtime/event used for session messages
chatgpt.com/backend-api/conversation
__CHAT_RELAY_RUNTIME_*
CHAT_RELAY_DEFAULT_SESSION_ID
block.bindings persisted in canvas localStorage
snapshot on every event
setInterval status polling for correctness
production createMockChatRelayContext fallback
```

## Worker rules (binding)

- Implement ONLY the assigned task. Edit ONLY the owned files listed in the packet.
- Use ONLY the context in the task packet (contracts + packet + inlined source).
- Do NOT read/grep/glob other files (tools denied). Missing detail → implement against
  the packet, report as "uncertain" in the handoff.
- Do NOT regenerate SDK/OpenAPI or rebuild the embedded UI. Do NOT edit central
  aggregation files (`api.ts`, `handlers.ts`, `routes.ts`, httpapi server composition,
  generated files, lockfile).
- Run only the targeted validation command(s) in the packet.
- Write `HANDOFF.md` beside your owned files with: files changed, tests run + result,
  public exports added/removed, assumptions, known limitations, integration actions
  required by M, prohibited-pattern search result (grep the strings above over your diff).
